    "### The problem being examined today is customers leaving the telco firm. This is referred to as 'churn.' We know that customers leave, but the firm would like to understand why it is that they leave. While customers can leave for any reason at any time, there are factors which will influence their choice to leave. This presentation will seek to understand and predict, to some degree, factors that the telco firm has control over which may lead to customers leaving them. "
